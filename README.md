# 02_textbook_exercises

Use these exercises as an opportunity to practice with loops and functions AND to practice using git.

## Required Commits

Each time you complete an exercise, make a commit recording your progress.
You can also make commits when you make progress on a problem.
There are 5 exercises in this repository, one in each file.
That means you should have **at least 5 commits** in this repository.
It's OK to have more than 5.

## How do I know how many commits I made?

In your terminal in VSCode, you can run the command `git log` to see your past commits.

**OR**

In GitHub, on your repository's main page, there will be a link in the upper right hand corner of the files list.
The link will say "N commits" for however many commits you've made.
You can click on this link to see those commits.

## What should I do if I already commited multiple exercises together?

If you accidentally commit multiple exercises all at once, please make a new file.
In this file, draw a shape, then make a git commit saying that you made that shape.
Do this until you've made a total of *at least* 5 commits.
